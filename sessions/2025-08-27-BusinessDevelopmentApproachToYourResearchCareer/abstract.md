### Session Title
> “Business development approach to growing your research” with ARC BITA’s Dr Tony Beatton and Dr Steve Bickley

### Abstract
> After years and years of study you are nearing the end of the long difficult pathway to the PhD. The thesis was successfully defended at the Final Seminar, edits complete and the Thesis is finally submitted for marking by Reviewers Unknown. If I am lucky the review will be complete in three months and I will get my PhD parchment, the ticket to a permanent job in academia. In reality, few recently graduated PhDs go straight into a permanent university job. For some of us who have that ‘killer’ paper we wrote during our PhD, we are snapped up by a top university in expectation that we will continue to publish our research papers in top academic journals. The vision of joining the pathway that begins with a tenured university lecturer position and sees us retire as a ‘much-cited’ and famous university professor is the dream of many newly minted PhDs.
>
> This presentation offers a recipe to develop marketable talents that could lead to us a career of research contribution. It does this not by following the ‘research processes’ so often directed by the research departments of our universities. Certainly, ethics approvals and correct completion of ARC & NHMRC research submissions are necessary but in today’s research environment they are not sufficient. If we are to enjoy a career as a top-paid researcher we need a competitive edge, something that lifts us above other researchers. The presentation continues with the story of a typical research opportunity, like those that all too often remain in our bottom drawer, never completed. Out of the ashes an alternative approach to developing a research career is offered: ‘A Business Development Approach to a Research Career’.


### Learning outcomes
- Identify the real post-PhD career landscape and define your personal value proposition/edge. 
- Apply a business-development workflow to research (opportunity scouting → stakeholder mapping → proposal → deliverable). 
- Convert “bottom-drawer” ideas into publishable outputs with a simple repeatable plan. 
- Build a research, partnership & funding pipeline (ARC/NHMRC/industry) while staying compliant (ethics, IP, attribution). 

### Who should attend
- Late-stage PhD candidates and recent graduates (0–3 yrs ECRs/postdocs). 
- Early-career academics/lecturers seeking a faster path to outputs, funding, and collaborations. 
- HDR supervisors & research managers mentoring HDRs/ECRs on career strategy. 
- Applied/industry researchers exploring university–industry collaboration pathways.
